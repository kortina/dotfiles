### Installation

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/kortina/dotfiles/
    cd dotfiles
    git submodule update --init
    ./setup.sh

You should see the following output on sucessful install:

NB: If you want s3screenshots, you will need to install following the [README](https://github.com/kortina/dotfiles/tree/master/s3screenshots)

`setup.sh` will run all of the following setup scripts:

- `setup-homebrew.sh` - install and update homebrew.
- `setup-deps.sh` - install all dependencies, such as `docker` and other libs and packages.
- `setup-symlinks.sh` - create symlinks from your home directory to any files that begin with a `.` in your `~/dotfiles` directory.
- `setup-osx.sh` - configure some osx preferences.

Each of this scripts can also be run independently (which may be faster for making small changes).

### FAQ

- If you get a permissions error, I recommened setting yourself as owner of `/usr/local`:

```
sudo chown -R "`id -u -n`:admin" /usr/local
```

### Themes

    # install terminal theme
    open "themes/tomorrow-theme/OS X Terminal/Tomorrow Night.terminal"

### fzf

`setup-deps.sh` will run `brew install fzf` which creates
`~/.fzf.bash` and `~/.fzf/`. In my `~/.bash_mac` I source `~/.fzf.bash`
to get all of the default terminal keybindings for `fzf` like
`ctrl-r` for history search. Then, I have my personal `fzf` settings
in `~/.fzf.conf.bash`

Last time I setup a machine, I had to run the vim setup to get fzf working...
